## Bubble utility - binary file mover ( node express server )
#### send binary files from / to
- running your own server (PAAS), is getting more feasible for some no-code projects. Heroku / Scalingo / github promote lo-complexity solution, adding a server process. This process may be a better alternative to Plugin solutions that may, in cases involving private AWS buckets, expose very [complex configuration](https://docs.zeroqode.com/plugins/aws-file-uploader-plugin) issues. 
- move around binary files, with Endpoints or with API Connector using 2, encoded Urls  (from , to) as parameters. For, example to move/copy a jpeg from AWS S3 platform to another, 3rd party fileSys as a service, the Url for the Endpoint/ connector would be :

```
http://localhost:3000/files/https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fyayatv-dev%2F3c6429451c4c3af2d8e18085f957e612_image.jpeg/https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fyayatv-dev%2F3c6429451c4c3af2d8e18085f957e612_image.jpeg
```
and the node express route corresponding to the above client request is :

```
app.get('/files/:from/:to',  function(req, resp, next) {
  var url1, url2 = "";
```

Response is standard **http.response**

#### upload binary file to your AWS S3 bucket
 back-end (server-side) to UI dialog with file chooser. Uploads binary files to AWS S3 bucket ( config in ENV on the server). Bubble (UI-side) native html runs Fetch.Post in the browser. Native bytes in the file ( bypassing reqmt for base64 encode, bypassing Strings) are transferred using Node-Streams for best performance without cap limits on size.

 **Client dtls - native html w JS -> fetch.Post()**

 **Server - input = file. Send file via S3 API**
 Call API - S3.upload(file) push the file to the config'd bucket, sending response below.
 ![express server API](./public/pics/npm_s3-bucket.png)
 Client code JS function runs binary file upload and the handler on server uses **node streams** to pipe the file on to AWS API upload(file).

**Image Upload to AWS**
```
[Sample client side code](https://jsfiddle.net/rowntreerob/c94f5t3k/99/)
[Server code route](https://github.com/rowntreerob/sampleexpress/blob/master/app.js#L108)  is **/awsupl**
Client side code specifies mime type **photo/png**
Server logs show the json response as client would get it.

**Video Upload to AWS**
```
![Sample client side code](./public/pics/vid_upl_aws.png)
[Server code route](https://github.com/rowntreerob/sampleexpress/blob/master/app.js#L130) is **/awsvid**
Client side code specifies mime type **video/mp4**
photo above (jsfiddle code ) shows json response in lower right hand side with the console output.

Intended for devs with some node.express and some npm and some git background.

## Download, Install ##
using std. git.clone and node.npm.install

## dev run   localhost:3000 ##
```
cd $PROJECT_ROOT
node app    or  if .env used then run using belo
heroku local       // this pulls in .env values on localhost
```

use curl client , use Postman for client
remember to urlencode  each of the 2 url parms located in the full url's path.

## Config AWS S3, api specified Security (headers) ##
npm module **s3-bucket** connects to that service and needs values in following (env vars set on server):
![bubble ui](./public/pics/s3-bucket_var.png)
in dev, per heroku implementation, manual edit on file=.env and then run on localhost w **heroku local** in term.

Use dashboard ( scalingo OR heroku ) for set Prod env var values.
